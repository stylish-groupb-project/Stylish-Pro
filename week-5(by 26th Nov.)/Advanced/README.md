# Week 6 - Part 1

## Overview of What We Should Complete This Week

Finish the final part of our website.

## Today's Focus
1. Design the pages for login/logout with following features:
   - Login page
     + Make sure the password field is hidden.
   - Profile page
     + Show the user's `name`, `email`, and `order history`.
     + Include a button to `log out`.
   - Make sure payment isn't allowed until the user logs in.
   - Add the user's `name` to the thankyou page.
2. Create a 404 page for when a page can't be found.
3. Create a maintenance page for when the backend service is down.

## Advanced Optional

- Pick one of these login guides ([Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web), [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/display-button#html)) and add the login button to our page where people log in.
- Once someone logs in, we need to retrieve their profile.
