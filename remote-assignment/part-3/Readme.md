# 🌐 Remote Learning Assignment - Week 3

## 📍 Goal
This week, we aim for everyone to practice front-end slicing and get familiar with tools like ChatGPT, Google, and Chrome DevTools.
> **🔔 Note:** Utilizing ChatGPT can significantly enhance our learning and development efficiency. I highly recommend you spend some time learning how to make the most of this tool.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Set up **VSCode** as your IDE.
- Explore **Chrome DevTools**, focusing on: `Elements`, `Console`, and `Styles`.
- Install **Node v16**. It's required for React and Next.js.

## 📌 Overview

In this assignment, we'll use React and Next.js to create a simple interactive post. We'll also explore different styling methods with Styled-Components and Tailwind.
1. Realize post layout
2. Like the post or retract the like.
3. **Provide answers to the listed "Understanding Check" directly on the post.**

> **🔔 Reminder:** Adhering to coding conventions is important. Ensure you're in sync with widely recognized practices. For guidance, consult the [Airbnb Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react#naming). Focus especially on: `Naming`, `Quotes`, `Spacing`, `Props`, `Parentheses`, `Tags`.

## 📚 React

1. Start your journey with [Create React App - Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) and the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
2. Utilize Styled Components [Install Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)[Styled Components - Getting Started](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started) to style your project.
3. Design your page with React and Styled-Component using the provided video as a guide.
4. Design mock data from `getPostData.js` to show post details.

## 📘 Next.js

1. Kickstart with [Create Next.js App - Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation).
   > **🔔 Note:** We'll be skipping app routing for now. Ensure your settings mirror [the given example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T5dJi5z2M4809rMif5K-IWJQXAtjgfwo/view?usp=sharing).

2. Utilize [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to style your project.
3. Design your page with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, using the provided video as a guide.
4. Again, use `getPostData.js` mock data to show post details.

## ❓ Understanding Check

Answer the questions and add them to your post (under "This is a sample post."):

- Why do we use Node.js? What does it do?
- Explain the Styled-Component you made. What's CSS-in-JS, and how does it help compared to regular CSS?
- Discuss `useState` and `useEffect`. How did you use them?
- Describe Client-Side Rendering vs. Server-Side Rendering. How did you achieve Server-Side Rendering in Next.js? Think about `getServerSideProps`.
- Which coding styles did you follow when coding?

## 🌟 Advanced Tasks (Optional)

- Think of a website with great user experience. What makes it good? Highlight three front-end aspects.
- Utilize TypeScript in your Next.js project.

## 📤 Submission Guidelines

1. Separate React and Next.js work to 2 folders and to 2 commits then create 2 pull requests from `dev` to `main`:
 ```
   - Folder: react-file -> <your code>
   - Commit: remote-week3: React_post_commit
   - PR: remote-week3: React_post_commit (with Elastic IP)
 ```
 ```
   - Folder: nextjs-file -> <your code>
   - Commit: remote-week3: Nextjs_post_commit
   - PR: remote-week3: Nextjs_post_commit (with Elastic IP)
 ```
   🚫 **NOTICE:** Incorrect commit messages won't be accepted.  
   🚫 **NOTICE:** Please deploy your 2 projects to EC2 and provide the Elastic IP with the pull requests for mentor to visit.  
   🚫 **NOTICE:** Please make sure you had answered "Understanding Check" on whichever post.  

2. Bravo! 🎉 Having wrapped up this week's tasks, alert your mentor for a review of your GitHub repository.
