# 🌐 Remote Learning Assignment - Week 3

## 📍 Goal
This week, we aim for everyone to practice front-end slicing and get familiar with tools like ChatGPT, Google, and Chrome DevTools.
> **🔔 Note:** Utilizing ChatGPT can significantly enhance our learning and development efficiency. I highly recommend you spend some time learning how to make the most of this tool.

## 🚀 Getting Started

- Set up **VSCode** as your IDE.
- Explore **Chrome DevTools**, focusing on: `Elements`, `Console`, and `Styles`.
- Install **Node v16**. It's required for React and Next.js.

## 📌 Overview

In this assignment, we'll use React and Next.js to create a simple interactive post. We'll also explore different styling methods with Styled-Components and Tailwind.
1. Realize post layout
2. Like the post or retract the like.
3. Provide answers to the listed "Understanding Check" directly on the post.

> **🔔 Reminder:** Adhering to naming conventions is important. Ensure you're in sync with widely recognized practices. For guidance, consult the [Airbnb Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react#naming). Focus especially on: `Naming`, `Quotes`, `Spacing`, `Props`, `Parentheses`, `Tags`.

## 📚 React

1. Start your journey with [Create React App - Getting Started](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) and the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
2. Incorporate Styled Components [Install Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)[Styled Components - Getting Started](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#getting-started) into your project.
3. Design your page with React and Styled-Component using the provided video as a guide.
4. Use mock data from `getPostData.js` to show post details.

## 📘 Next.js

1. Kickstart with [Create Next.js App - Getting Started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation).
   > **🔔 Note:** We'll be skipping app routing for now. Ensure your settings mirror the given example.

2. Integrate [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) into your project.
3. Design your page with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, using the provided video as a guide.
4. Again, use `getPostData.js` mock data to show post details.

## ❓ Understanding Check

Answer the questions and add them to your post (under "This is a sample post."):

- Why do we use Node.js? What does it do?
- Explain the Styled-Component you made. What's CSS-in-JS, and how does it help compared to regular CSS?
- Discuss `useState` and `useEffect`. How did you use them?
- Describe Client-Side Rendering vs. Server-Side Rendering. How did you achieve Server-Side Rendering in Next.js? Think about `getServerSideProps`.
- Which naming rules did you follow when coding?

## 🌟 Advanced Tasks (Optional)

- Think of a website with great user experience. What makes it good? Highlight three front-end aspects.
- Try adding TypeScript to your Next.js project.

## 📤 Submission Guidelines

1. Save changes to the `dev` branch. Use this commit message format:
   > 🚫 **NOTICE:** Incorrect commit messages won't be accepted.
2. Create a pull request from `dev` to `main`. Include:
- Elastic IP address
- Database name
- Change summary

3. Bravo! 🎉 Having wrapped up this week's tasks, alert your mentor for a review of your GitHub repository.
