## What should we do?

1. Connect to our backend service and add the following features to the index page using React Query:
   - `List Products`: Display products from your backend.
   - `Filter Products by Category`: Allow users to select categories and display the corresponding products after filtering.
   - `Search Products`: Allow users to search for products based on their title.

## Advanced Optional

Here's some features to improve our user experience of page:

- Display the product list with infinite scrolling. When users scroll down to the bottom of the page, we'll automatically load and show the next page.
- Add a skeleton loader to show that the page is loading while waiting for the network response.
