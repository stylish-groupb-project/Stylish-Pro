In this week, we'll need to complete all of the pages from [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sKhc4A0Gi427u1I5leT5ug/STYLiSH).

## Today's Focus

Create a product page with responsive design (set the breakpoint to 1280px).
- Product Detail: Display the product details from our backend service.
- Product Variants:
  + Each product has different variants, allowing users to choose their preferred color and size.
  + The stock of each product is limited, so there is a limit on the number of items users can buy at one time.
  + If a variant is out of stock, users cannot select it.
- Shopping Cart:
  + Use localStorage to temporarily store the products users add to their cart before they check out, without using the backend service.
  + Display the number of items in the cart icon.

## Advanced Optional

Study about localStorage, sessionStorage and cookie.
