In this week, we'll need to complete all of the pages from [figma](https://www.figma.com/file/sKhc4A0Gi427u1I5leT5ug/STYLiSH).

## Today's Focus

Create a checkout page with responsive design (set the breakpoint to 1280px).
- Modify Order:
  + Retrieve the cart data that we've saved.
  + Update all amounts automatically after adding or removing items from the shopping cart.
- Input Validation:
  + Validate phone numbers and email addresses using the correct patterns.
  + Mask phone numbers, card numbers, and CCV codes when the input is not in focus.
- Payment:
  + After payment is complete, design a `Thank You` page that displays the order number and payment time.

## ðŸ’¡ Recap
- Make sure you keep in mind error handling, credential data mask are key features for FE development
