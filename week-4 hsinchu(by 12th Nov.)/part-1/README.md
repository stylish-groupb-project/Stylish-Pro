# **Week 4 - Part 1**

### **Overview of What We Should Complete This Week**

This week, we'll focus on diving deep into the implementation of Amazon S3, Redis caching, and SSL configurations. These technologies are pivotal for the performance and security of modern websites and applications.

### **Today's Focus**

### **Implementing Amazon S3**

Amazon S3, or Simple Storage Service, is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides scalable object storage. This is ideal for storing large files, backups, or even user-generated content. Its global infrastructure ensures high availability and durability.

- Set up an AWS S3 bucket.
- Integrate S3 with the existing `**[POST]**/products` API, which already employs `multer` module for file upload logic.
- Implement checks:If any of these conditions aren't met, return a 400 status code.
    1. Ensure files are restricted to `**jpg**`, `**png**`, and  `**jpeg**` formats.
    2. Set a file size ceiling at `**2 MB**`.
- Upon successful upload to S3, retrieve the generated S3 link and store it in the database for reference and retrieval.

**Note**: Ensure that you have configured the appropriate bucket policies, allowing only authorized users to update the data within the bucket while keeping it publicly accessible.

### **SSL Configuration with Let's Encrypt and Nginx**

Let's Encrypt is a free, automated, and open Certificate Authority (CA) that provides SSL certificates. Using SSL with Nginx, especially when sourced from Let's Encrypt, is crucial for safeguarding your website. It encrypts the data between the user's web browser and the server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

- Acquire an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.
- Configure your Nginx server to integrate the Let's Encrypt SSL certificate, ensuring it serves content over HTTPS.

**Note**: Remember to regularly renew your Let's Encrypt certificate, as they have a shorter validity period than most certificates.

## **Advanced Topics for Early Implementation or Research:**

1. **S3 with CDN Integration**:
By pairing S3 with a Content Delivery Network (CDN) like Amazon CloudFront, you can deliver this content to users more rapidly and reduce latency. CDNs cache content in multiple geographic locations to serve it faster to users from the nearest point.
2. **Understanding SSL and Digital Signatures**:
SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a protocol that ensures data encryption between two systems, like a web browser and a server. By studying the operation of symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and digital signatures, one can gain a deeper understanding of how trust is established and maintained in digital communications.
